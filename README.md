# template-magic
Old-school Alexandrescu tricks sweetened with modern C++ syntax sugar and possibly some more stuff.

This project intends to represent some new metaprogramming tricks and bizzare techniques. Different code snippets with no structure and plan so far. If you have any comments on the code represented, don't hesitate to start discussion in Issues or whatever option you like. Your contribution is warmly welcomed.
